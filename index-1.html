<p>Randomly simulates a determinantally-thinned Poisson point process on a rectangle. I believe this is a new type of point process, originally proposed by Blaszczyszyn and Keeler in the paper[1]: </p>
<p>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08672</p>
<p>A determinantally-thinned (Poisson) point process is essentially a discrete determinantal point process whose underlying state space is a single realization of a (Poisson) point process defined on some bounded continuous space. This is a repulsive point process, where the repulsion depends on the kernel and average density of points. For more details, see the paper by Blaszczyszyn and Keeler[1].</p>
<p>An obvious question is whether a determinantally-thinned Poisson point process is <em>also</em> a determinantal point process? The answer, we believe, is no, but it's from obvious. </p>
<p>I added the code for simulating a Poisson point process, which was the easy part. To simulate the (discrete) determinantal point process, I modified the code in sample_dpp.py from this repository:</p>
<p>https://github.com/mbp28/determinantal-point-processes</p>
<p>I originally wrote all code in R and in MATLAB, which both have a very similar structure; see:  </p>

<p>https://github.com/hpaulkeeler/DetPoisson_MATLAB</p>
<p>It should be noted that there are a number of repositories with Python code for simulating (discrete) determinantal point processes. A very comprehensive one with various simulation methods (for both discrete and continuous point processes) is the following: </p>
